# Rusty Mirror
Copyright (c) 2019 Sam Shippey and Katelyn Rule

In this project, we aim to create a smart mirror that has rudimentary voice recognition 
using an API, and has basic weather information displayed graphically on the smart mirror. 
We would like to use Rust to automatically load up and run these functionalities with 
minimal human set up.

Ideally, this would become akin to a DIY echo show that is more aesthetically pleasing. 
Possible additional functionalities may include:

* Voice activated calculator
* Voice activated internet search

This is a class project, and thus is a work in progress. Expect to see many changes to this document and the code as this project develops.

## Basic functionalities:
* Time
* Weather

## Advanced functionalities:
* Calendar
* Basic facial recognition
* Alexa/Google Home
* Basic machine learning
* Voice activated calculator
* Voice activated internet search
